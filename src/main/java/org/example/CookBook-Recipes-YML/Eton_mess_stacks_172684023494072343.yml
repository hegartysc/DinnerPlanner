ingredients: |
  1 egg white
  350 g icing sugar
  1 tsp crushed cardamom seeds
  1 little oil for greasing
  142 ml pot double cream
  1 juice 1⁄2 lemon
  250 g punnet raspberry
directions: |
  Lightly whisk the egg white, then stir in the icing sugar and cardamom to make a firm fondant icing. Roll the icing into 8 golfballsize balls (you probably won’t need all of it). Two at a time, place the balls at opposite ends of a greased piece of baking paper, then microwave for 30-40 secs on High until quadrupled in size. Leave to cool for a few mins, then lift off the paper and repeat until all the balls are cooked.

  Whip the cream with half the lemon juice. Crush half the raspberries, then fold through the cream. To serve, place a little splodge of raspberry cream onto each plate. Stack a meringue with some more cream, then place another meringue on top. Spoon over more cream, then top with a few whole raspberries. Dust with icing sugar and serve.
