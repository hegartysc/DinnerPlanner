  1 Tbsp Smooth Peanut Butter Spread

  Prepare the ingredients:

  Wash and dry the peppers. Cut off and discard the stems of the peppers; remove the cores, then large dice. Halve, peel, and medium dice the onion. In a bowl, whisk together the tomato paste, peanut butter, sugar, and as much of the chile paste as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. In a separate bowl, combine the sour cream and 2 teaspoons of water; season with salt and pepper.

  Make the pepper rice:

  In a medium pot, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced peppers and diced onion; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until slightly softened. Add the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter); stir to combine. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, without stirring, 16 to 18 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork.

  Toast the pepitas:

  Meanwhile, in a medium pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the pepitas; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned (be careful, as the pepitas may pop as they toast). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

  Form the meatballs:

  In a bowl, combine the chorizo and breadcrumbs. Gently mix until just combined. Shape the mixture into 10 tightly packed meatballs. Transfer to a plate.

  Cook the meatballs & serve your dish:

  In the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the meatballs. Cook, turning occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until browned on all sides. Using a spoon, move the meatballs to one side of the pan. Add the chipotle-peanut mixture to the other side. Cook, stirring frequently, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add 1 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid may splatter). Cook, stirring frequently and spooning the sauce over the meatballs, 5 to 7 minutes, or until the meatballs are cooked through* and the sauce is thickened. Turn off the heat. Taste, then season with salt and pepper if desired. Serve the cooked meatballs and sauce over the pepper rice. Garnish with the seasoned sour cream and toasted pepitas. Enjoy!
