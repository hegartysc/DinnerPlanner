  Pack in the veg with our flavour-packed Japanese-inspired yaki udon. It's healthy, takes just 25 minutes to make, and is low in fat and calories
ingredients: |
  1 Beef mince
  1.5 tbsp sesame oil
  1 red onion (cut into thin wedges)
  160 g mangetout
  70 g baby corn (halved)
  2 baby pak choi (quartered)
  3 spring onions (sliced)
  1 large garlic clove (crushed)
  0.5 tbsp mild curry powder (or use 1 tsp garam masala)
  4 tsp low-salt soy sauce
  300 g ready-to-cook udon noodles
  1 tbsp pickled sushi ginger (chopped, plus 2 tbsp of the brine, optional)
directions: |
  Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan or wok over a high heat. Add the onion and fry for 5 mins. Stir in the mangetout, corn, pak choi and spring onions and cook for 5 mins more. Add the garlic, curry powder and soy sauce, and cook for another minute.

  Add the udon noodles along with the ginger (if using) and reserved brine, and stir in 2-3 tbsp hot water until the noodles are heated through. Divide between bowls and serve.
