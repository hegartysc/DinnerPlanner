ingredients: |
  260 g diced chicken breast
  150 g jasmine rice
  1 ginger
  2 cloves garlic
  1 scallion
  250 g mushrooms
  1 onion
  1 Soy sauce
  1 Sesame seeds
  1 "BBQ Rub"
directions: |
  Cook the rice. Drain, cover, and leave to the side until ready to serve.

  Meanwhile, halve, pool, and thinly slice the onion.

  Roughly chop the mushrooms.

  Trim and thinly slice the scallions.

  Peel and grate the garlic and ginger.

  Place a pan over medium heat (no oil).

  Once hot, fry the sesame seeds until toaster, stirring regularly.

  Remove from the pan and set aside.

  In a large bowl, mix 2 tbsp sugar, ginger, garlic, soy sauce, BBQ rub, and half the sesame seeds.

  If you've got one, use a food processor to mix into a smooth paste.

  Mix the chicken through your marinade then allow to sit for 5-10 mins.

  While the chicken is marinated, return your (not empty) pan to high heat with a drizzle of oil.

  Once the oil is hot, fry the onion and mushroom until softened, 4-5 mins. Stir occasionally. Season.

  Add the chicken and fry until golden brown and cooked through 8-10 mins. Turn every 2-3 mins.

  If required, add a splash of water to the pan to loosen it.

  Divide the rice between bowls and top with the chicken bulgogi. Season.
