ingredients: |
  170 g bacon
  2 flatbreads
  125 g mushrooms
  0.5 pack passata
  50 g grated cheese
  1 Dried thyme
directions: |
  Preheat the over to 200c fan.

  Place a large pan over high heat (no oil).

  Thinly slice the mushrooms.

  Once the pan is hot, add the mushrooms and cook until charred, 3-4 mins. Turn only every 2 mins.

  Once cooked, season, then transfer to a bowl.

  Wipe the pan and save it for use later.

  Mix together half the passata, half the dried thyme, and 1/2 tbsp sugar. Season.

  Use a spoon to spread the sauce over each of the flatbreads, leaving a 1 cm border around the edge.

  Scatter the cheese over the top.

  Top the flatbreads with the charred mushrooms.

  Carefully pop your flatbreads onto a lined baking tray.

  Bake in your oven until the cheese has melted and is bubbling, 8-10 mins.

  Meanwhile, return your (now empty) pan to medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil. Once the oil is hot, lay in the bacon and fry until cirspy and brown, 3-4 min on each side.

  Transfer to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Tear the bacon into small pieces.

  Remove the flatbreads from the oven and cut them into slices. Top with the torn bacon.
