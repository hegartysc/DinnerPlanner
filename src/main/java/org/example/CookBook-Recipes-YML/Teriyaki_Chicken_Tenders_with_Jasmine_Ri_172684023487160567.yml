directions: |
  Wash and dry all produce. Adjust rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring 2½ cups water and a large pinch of salt to a boil in a medium pot. Peel ginger and mince until you have 2 TBSP. Mince garlic. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Halve lime; cut one half into wedges.

  Once water is boiling, add rice to pot. Cover, lower heat, and reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and keep covered.

  Toss green beans with a large drizzle of oil on a baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast in oven until crisp, 10-12 minutes. After they’ve finished roasting, toss green beans with 2 tsp sesame oil, half the sesame seeds, and a squeeze of lime (we sent more oil than needed).

  Heat a large drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Pat chicken dry with a paper towel. Add to pan and cook until browned but not cooked through, 2-4 minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside. TIP: Don’t overcrowd the pan with chicken—you may want to work in batches.

  Heat a large drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Whisk together soy sauce, ¼ cup sugar, 2 TBSP vinegar (we sent more), and cornstarch in a small bowl. Put scallion whites, garlic, and ginger in pan and cook, tossing, until softened, 1-2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce mixture and bring to a simmer. Let thicken slightly, about 2 minutes.

  Add chicken to pan and toss to coat. Cook until no longer pink in center, 2-3 minutes. Add a squeeze of lime to rice, then fluff with a fork. Divide rice, green beans, and chicken between plates. Drizzle with any sauce in pan. Sprinkle with scallion greens and remaining sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges.
