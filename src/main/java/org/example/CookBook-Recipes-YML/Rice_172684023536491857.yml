  How to cook rice on the stove

  1 cup basmati rice per serving (or weigh 75g per person)

  2 cups (or 150ml) water

  Measure the rice into a cup and level the top, or weigh the amount of servings you want into a jug and note the liquid level it comes up to.

  Pour the rice into a bowl and pour in enough cold water to cover it. Jostle and move the rice in the water to remove the starch

  Drain well using a sieve, then repeat the rinsing process until the water becomes clear, once jostled. If you have time, soak the rice in cold water for at least 30 minutes. This will help the grains cook more evenly.

  Tip the rice into a pan over a low heat.

  Add double the volume of water to rice (2 cups, or 150ml water for a 75g serving) plus some salt, if you like.

  Bring to a boil. Swirl the rice in the pan (or stir once) to make sure it’s well distributed.

  Put a lid on and turn the heat down to as low as possible. If you cook the rice on too high a heat, it will cook too quickly and may end up chalky in the centre.

  Simmer gently for 10 mins and do not take the lid off. Check the rice is cooked at the end by trying a grain - this should also be indicated by the appearance of small holes on the surface and all the water having been absorbed. Keep cooking for another couple of mins if it isn’t quite ready, then turn the heat off.

  Fluff the rice with a fork and serve it straightaway if you like in a bowl, but if you cover it with a tea towel for 10 minutes, any residual water will be absorbed. You can then fluff up the grains for an even better texture.
