ingredients: |
  400 g penne
  4 sausages
  8 slices streaky bacon or pancetta
  1 onion (finely chopped)
  3 large egg yolks
  4 tbsp single cream
  85 g parmesan (finely grated)
  1 small bunch parsley (finely chopped)
directions: |
  Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, squeeze the meat out of the sausage casings and, with damp or lightly oiled hands, roll into small-ish balls.

  Heat a frying pan and cook the bacon or pancetta until really crispy. Remove and keep warm. Fry the sausageballs until golden and cooked through, remove and keep warm (a low oven is good for this). Cook the onion in the fat from the bacon and sausageballs (tip some out if you need to) until soft.

  In a small bowl, mix the egg yolks, cream, most of the Parmesan and most of the parsley with lots of black pepper and a pinch of salt. Drain the pasta, reserving a ladle of water. Tip the pasta back into the pan, off the heat, and add the egg mix, onions and sausageballs. Mix well, adding some pasta water until you have a sauce that coats the pasta. Tip into bowls, scatter over the remaining parsley and Parmesan, and top with the bacon.
