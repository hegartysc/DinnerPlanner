  1 clove garlic

directions: |
  Quarter the mushrooms.

  Trim the pak choi then halve lengthways.

  Peel and grate the garlic.

  Trim the carrot, then quarter lengthways (no need to peel). Chop widthways into small pieces.

  Thinly slice the chilli.

  Place a large pot over high heat with a drizzle of oil.

  Add the mushrooms and carrot and fry until softened, 5-6 mins*.

  Add the Thai Spices and Korma Paster and fry for 2-3 mins.

  Add the coconut milk, stock, and 300ml of water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer the soup for 12-14 mins.

  With 1 min left to cook, add the noodles to the soup to allow them to warm through. Season to taste.

  Meanwhile, place a pan over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil.

  Once hot, lay in the pak choi. Season.

  Cook on one side for 2 mins then turn over and cook for another 2 mins on the other side.

  Add the garlic and fry for 1 min. The pak choi should be slightly browned and charred.

  Add a splash of water, pop a lid on the pan, and leave to steam for another 3 mins.

  Divide the soup between bowls.

  Top with the garlic pak choi and sliced chilli.
