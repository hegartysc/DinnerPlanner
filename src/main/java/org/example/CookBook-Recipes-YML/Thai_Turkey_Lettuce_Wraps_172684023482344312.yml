  Prepare the Ingredients:

  Trim and thinly slice green onions on an angle, keeping white and green portions separate.Separate leaves of lettuce for cups. Slight browning on the outer leaves of lettuce is normal and safe to eat, but can be trimmed if desired.If using diced chicken, pat dry and season with a pinch of salt.

  Cook the Turkey:

  Place a medium non-stick pan over medium-high heat with 2 tsp. olive oil.Add ground turkey to hot pan. Stir often, breaking up with a spoon, until no pink remains, 7-9 minutes.If using ground beef, stir occasionally until no pink remains, 4-6 minutes. Carefully drain off excess fat. If using diced chicken, stir occasionally until chicken browns and reaches a minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees, 5-7 minutes.

  Finish the Turkey:

  Add hoisin sauce, water chestnuts, half the Sriracha, white portions of green onions, and ginger to pan. Stir occasionally, 3-4 minutes.Taste, and add remaining Sriracha and a pinch of salt and pepper, if desired.Remove from burner.

  Build the Lettuce Wraps:

  Place a lettuce cup on a clean work surface (or layer two cups for extra crunch and structural support).Fill with a few spoonfuls of turkey mixture and top with slaw mix.Repeat for about five more lettuce cups.

  Finish the Dish:

  Combine Asian sesame dressing and green portions of green onions in a mixing bowl.Plate dish as pictured on front of card, serving sesame dipping sauce on the side to drizzle on wraps.
