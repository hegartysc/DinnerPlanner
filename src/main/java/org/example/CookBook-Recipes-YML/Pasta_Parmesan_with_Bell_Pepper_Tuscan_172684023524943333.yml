notes: |
  Pasta in tomato sauce can be a fantastic feast—it just needs a few accents to take it beyond basic. Luckily, we’ve got some good ones. This penne in marinara comes with bell pepper, Tuscan herbs and spices, a cheesy breadcrumb crust, and a drizzle of basil oil. Once you’ve tossed everything together and popped it in the oven, you’re just minutes away from cheesy, herbaceous, saucy, and just ever so slightly spicy bliss.
ingredients: |
  1 unit Bell Pepper
  1 unit Yellow Onion
  2 clove Garlic
  4 ounce Fresh Mozzarella
  6 ounce Penne Pasta
  1 tablespoon Tuscan Heat Spice
  14 ounce Marinara Cup
  0.25 cup Parmesan Cheese
  0.25 cup Panko Breadcrumbs
  5 teaspoon Basil Oil
  1 tablespoon Olive Oil
  1 Salt
  1 Pepper
directions: |
  Heat broiler to high. Bring a large pot

  of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry

  all produce. Core, deseed, and dice bell

  pepper. Halve, peel, and dice onion.

  Mince or grate garlic. Cut mozzarella

  into ½-inch cubes.

  Once water is boiling, add penne to

  pot. Cook until al dente, 9-11 minutes.

  Reserve ½ cup pasta cooking water (¾

  cup for 4 servings), then drain.

  Meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of

  olive oil in a large, preferably ovenproof,

  pan over medium-high heat. Add bell

  pepper and cook, stirring, until just

  browned, 4-6 minutes. Stir in onion,

  garlic, and half the Tuscan Heat Spice

  (you’ll use the rest later). Cook, stirring,

  until onion is softened, 3-5 minutes.

  Season with salt and pepper.

  Add marinara sauce, penne,

  remaining Tuscan Heat Spice, and

  reserved pasta cooking water to

  pan with veggies; stir to combine. Let

  simmer until warmed through, 3-4

  minutes. Stir in half the Parmesan

  (you’ll use the rest later). Season with

  plenty of salt and pepper. TIP: If your

  pan is not ovenproof, transfer pasta now

  to a baking dish.

  In a small bowl, stir together panko,

  remaining Parmesan, and a drizzle of

  olive oil. Top pasta with mozzarella,

  then panko mixture.

  Transfer pasta to top rack and

  broil until panko is golden brown, sauce

  is bubbly, and cheese has melted, 5-7

  minutes. (TIP: Watch carefully to avoid

  burning.) Let cool slightly, then divide

  between plates or bowls. Drizzle with

  basil oil and serve.
