ingredients: |
  500 g skinless (boneless chicken thighs)
  1 tsp flaky sea salt
  1 tsp Sichuan peppercorns (use normal peppercorns if you can't find these)
  1 tbsp cornflour
  1 tsp Chinese five-spice powder
  1 tsp sesame seeds
  1 tbsp olive oil
  1 tbsp soy sauce
  1 tbsp honey
  250 g Asian greens such as pak choi
  Handful chopped coriander (sliced spring onions and cooked rice, to serve)
directions: |
  Cut the chicken thighs into strips. Crush the salt with the peppercorns in a pestle and mortar, then mix with the cornflour and five-spice and tip into a sandwich bag. Tip the chicken into the bag and shake well to coat in the flour mixture.

  Toss the sesame seeds in a pan over a medium heat and lightly toast, for around a minute, then add the olive oil. Add the chicken and cook for 7-8 mins until golden brown.

  Mix the soy and honey and tip into the pan along with the Asian greens, cook for 2-3 mins further until everything is well coated and the greens are cooked through. Serve topped with coriander and sliced spring onions alongside some cooked rice.
