ingredients: |
  140 g butter (softened, plus extra for the tin)
  140 g caster sugar
  2 large eggs (beaten)
  140 g self-raising flour
  1 tsp baking powder
  2 very ripe bananas (mashed)
  50 g icing sugar
  handful dried banana chips (for decoration)
directions: |
  Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

  Butter a 2lb loaf tin and line the base and sides with baking parchment.

  Cream 140g softened butter and 140g caster sugar until light and fluffy, then slowly add 2 beaten large eggs with a little of the 140g flour.

  Fold in the remaining flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 2 mashed bananas.

  Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for about 50 mins, or until cooked through. Check the loaf at 5-min intervals from around 30-40 mins in the oven by testing it with a skewer (it should be able to be inserted and removed cleanly), as the time may vary depending on the shape of your loaf tin.

  Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then remove to a wire rack.

  Mix 50g icing sugar with 2-3 tsp water to make a runny icing.

  Drizzle the icing across the top of the cake and decorate with a handful of banana chips.
