ingredients: |
  225 g pork sausages
  180 g dried linguine
  1 pack passata
  25 g grated hard cheese
  1 onion
  2 cloves garlic
  1 Worchester sauce
directions: |
  Boil a large pot of salted water for the linguine.

  When boiling, add the linguine to the water and bring it back to a boil.

  Cook until softened, 12 mins.

  Once cooked, drain and pop back into the pot. Drizzle with oil and stir through to stop it from sticking together.

  Meanwhile, halve, peel, and thinly slice the onion.

  Peel and grate the garlic.

  Chop the pork sausages into 2cm chunks.

  Place a large pan over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil.

  When the oil is hot add the sausages and cook for 3-4 mins, shifting occasionally.

  Remove from the pan when cooked through.

  Return the (now empty) pan to the heat with another drizzle of oil, if necessary.

  Once hot, add the onion and season. Cook until softened, 4-6 mins, stirring occasionally.

  Add the garlic and fry until fragrant, 1 min.

  Stir in 75ml water, passata, and Worchester sauce.

  Simmer until thickened, 4-5 mins.

  Once thickened, add the sausage pieces to the sauce.

  Season to taste with salt, pepper, and sugar.

  Carefully toss the linguine in the sauce.

  Divide the sausage and tomato pasta between bowls. Garnish with grated cheese.
