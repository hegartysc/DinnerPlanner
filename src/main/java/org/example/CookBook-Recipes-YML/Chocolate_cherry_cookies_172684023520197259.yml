ingredients: |
  200 g unsalted butter (at room temperature)
  85 g light muscovado sugar
  85 g golden caster sugar
  1 egg
  225 g self-raising flour
  50 g plain chocolate (50-70% cocoa, roughly chopped)
  50 g white chocolate (roughly chopped)
  85 g natural colour glacé cherry (roughly chopped)
directions: |
  Heat oven to 190C/fan 170C/gas 5. Beat the butter, sugars and egg until smooth, then mix in the flour, chocolates and cherry pieces and ½ tsp salt. Spoon onto non-stick baking sheets in large rough blobs – you’ll get 20 out of this mix. Make sure they are well spaced as the cookies grow substantially as they bake. The raw dough can be frozen.

  Bake for 12-14 mins until just golden, but still quite pale and soft in the middle. If baking from frozen, give them a few mins more. Cool on the sheets for 5 mins, then lift onto racks with a fish slice and leave to cool completely.
