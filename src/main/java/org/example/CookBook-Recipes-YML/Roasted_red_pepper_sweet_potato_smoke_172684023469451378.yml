  1 sweet potato (roughly chopped into dice with the skin still on)
  1 red pepper (de-seeded and cut into chunks)
  1 red onion (peeled and cut into chunks)
  3 garlic cloves (peeled)
  1 tsp smoked paprika
  2 tbsp olive oil
  200 ml coconut milk
  200 ml chicken stock

  Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Put the sweet potato, pepper, onion and garlic on a baking tray. Sprinkle with the paprika and seasoning, then drizzle with the oil. Toss together. Roast for 30 mins or until beginning to brown.
