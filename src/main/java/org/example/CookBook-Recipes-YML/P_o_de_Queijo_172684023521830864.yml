ingredients: |
  500 g tapioca flour - You can easily find it at Brazilian Markets as "Polvilho"
  250 ml of full fat milk
  150 ml of vegetable oil
  150 g grated parmesan cheese
  475 g of grated white cheddar cheese
  2 large eggs
  1 teaspoon salt
directions: |
  Combine the milk, oil and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium high heat, stirring constantly.

  Add the tapioca flour to the bowl and, once the milk mixture boils, pour it over the flour. Mix it well. The texture will be fondant-like, really white and sticky.

  Once the mixture gets to a room temperature, add the eggs, one at a time. You will think they won't mix, since the tapioca flour mixture is so sticky, but hang in there because they will.

  Once the eggs are incorporated, add the cheese, a little at a time, until fully incorporated.

  The dough is supposed to be soft and sticky. However, if you're worried it's too liquid, add some more tapioca flour. Just don't over do it or your cheese bread will be tough and not too gooey. If it is too dry, add one more egg.

  To shape the balls, wet your hands with cold water and, using a spoon, scoop some of the dough to shape balls that are a little smaller than golf-sized.

  Bake it in a preheated oven at 180C for about 20/25 minutes. You can also freeze the rolled dough and bake it later
