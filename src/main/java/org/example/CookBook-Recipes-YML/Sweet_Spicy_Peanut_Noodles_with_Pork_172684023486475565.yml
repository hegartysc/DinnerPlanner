ingredients: |
  9 oz Lo Mein Noodles
  10 oz Ground Pork
  2.3 oz Peanut Butter
  48 ml Ponzu Sauce
  2 oz Sweet Thai Chili Sauce
  2 Mini Cucumber
  1 Salt
  1 Pepper
  1 tsp Cooking Oil
directions: |
  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.

  Trim ends from cucumbers; shave cucumber lengthwise into thin ribbons using a peeler, rotating as you go. Stop once you get to the seedy core; discard core.

  Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.

  Add pork and cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.

  Remove pan from heat.

  Once water is boiling, add lo mein to pot.

  Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 5-7 minutes. Drain and set aside.

  Return pan with pork to medium heat.

  Add peanut butter, ponzu, chili sauce, and 2 tbsp water to pan; cook, stirring, until well-combined and sauce is slightly thickened, 30-60 seconds.

  Remove pan from heat; add drained noodles and toss to coat.

  Divide noodles between bowls and top with cucumber ribbons. Serve.
