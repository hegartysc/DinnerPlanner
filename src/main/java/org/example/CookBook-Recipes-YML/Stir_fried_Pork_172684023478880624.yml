ingredients: |
  250 g pork mince
  150 g rice
  150 g sugar snap peas
  1 bell pepper
  1 clove garlic
  1 Teriyaki sauce
directions: |
  Cook the rice. Strain and leave to the side until ready to serve.

  While the rice cooked, halve the pepper and discard the core and seeds. Slice into thin strips.

  Peel and grate the garlic.

  Slice the sugar snaps in half.

  Place a medium pan over high heat with a drizzle of oil.

  Once the oil is hot, add the pepper.

  Stir-fry until just soft, 3-4 mins.

  Add the pork mince to the peppers and cook until browned, 5-66 mins.

  Use a spoon to break it up as it cooks. Season.

  Once the pork is browned, add the garlic to the pan and stir-fry for 1 min.

  Stir in the teriyaki sauce and cook for 1 min more.

  Taste and season. Add a splash of water if it's a little dry.

  Fluff up the rice with a fork, and share it between bowls. Top with the teriyaki pork stir-fry and sliced sugar snaps.
