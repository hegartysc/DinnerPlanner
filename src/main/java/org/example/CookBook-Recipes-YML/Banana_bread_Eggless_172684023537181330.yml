ingredients: |
  3 large black bananas
  75 ml vegetable oil or sunflower oil (plus extra for the tin)
  100 g brown sugar
  225 g plain flour (or use self-raising flour and reduce the baking powder to 2 heaped tsp)
  3 heaped tsp baking powder
  3 tsp cinnamon or mixed spice
  50 g dried fruit or nuts (optional)
directions: |
  Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Mash 3 large black peeled bananas with a fork, then mix well with 75g vegetable or sunflower oil and 100g brown sugar.

  Add 225g plain flour, 3 heaped tsp baking powder and 3 tsp cinnamon or mixed spice, and combine well. Add 50g dried fruit or nuts, if using.

  Bake in an oiled, lined 2lb loaf tin for 20 minutes. Check and cover with foil if the cake is browning.

  Bake for another 20 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.

  Allow to cool a little before slicing. It's delicious freshly baked, but develops a lovely gooey quality the day after.
