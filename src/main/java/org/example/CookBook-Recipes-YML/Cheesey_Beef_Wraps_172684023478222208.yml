ingredients: |
  250 g beef mince
  8 small tortillas
  50 g grated cheese
  1 avocado
  1 carrot
  1 Ketchup
  1 Ground Cumin
  1 Add rice?
directions: |
  Preheat the oven to 100c fan.

  Trim and grate the carrot (no need to peel).

  Heat a pan on medium-high heat (no oil).

  Once the pan is hot, add the beef mince and fry until browned, 5-6 mins. Use a spoon to break it up as it cooks. Season.

  Once the mince is cooked, add half the grated carrot, cumin, and ketchup to the pan.

  Add a splash of water and mix it together.

  Cook for 1 min and remove from the heat. Season.

  Lay the tortillas on a board, spoon some of the mince down the centre of each, then roll them up to enclose the filling.

  Drizzle a little oil into the bottom of an ovenproof dish then lay in the wraps.

  Pack them snugly, side by side, with the folded edge underneath so they don't unroll.

  Top with the grated cheese.

  Bake on the top shelf of your oven until golden, 8-10 mins.

  Meanwhile, halve the avocado and scoop out the flesh.

  Use a fork to mash it, and add a squeeze of lemon juice. Season and mix well.

  Once cooked, remove the wraps from the oven.

  Divide between plates. Top with the smashed avocado.
