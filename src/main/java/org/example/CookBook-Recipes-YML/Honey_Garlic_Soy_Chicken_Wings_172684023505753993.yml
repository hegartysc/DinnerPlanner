ingredients: |
  2 pounds wings
  For the garlic soy sauce:
  1 tablespoon oil
  3 cloves garlic minced
  3 tablespoons honey
  3 tablespoons soy sauce
  1 tablespoon sriracha or more (to taste)
directions: |
  Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top of it.

  Transfer chicken wings in a single layer onto the rack.

  Bake 50-60 minutes, flipping halfway through until the wings are golden and cooked through.

  While the wings are baking, heat a pan over medium-high heat. Add the oil and garlic and cook for 30 seconds or until garlic begins to brown. Stir in the remaining ingredients for the sauce and simmer for just a few seconds.

  Remove wings from the oven and toss into the sauce until fully coated. Serve immediately.
