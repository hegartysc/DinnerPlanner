ingredients: |
  1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast (cut into 1-inch cubes, 450g)
  2 teaspoons cornstarch (optional)
  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  1 tablespoon unsalted butter
  4 cloves garlic (finely minced)
  0.25 cup honey
  3 tablespoons low-sodium chicken stock
  1 or 2 tablespoons lemon juice
  1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional, we used Sriracha)
  1 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes (for garnish)
  1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)
  1 Cut chicken breast into cubes (about 1-inch pieces.)
  1 Dust chicken with cornstarch (salt, and pepper, cornstarch gives the chicken bites a slight crust so the sauce sticks to it better!)
  1 Sear chicken bites on all sides (then add garlic, lemon juice, chicken stock, and honey.)
  Cook until the sauce thickens and gets sticky. Sprinkle the honey garlic chicken bites with parsley and red chili pepper flakes.

directions: |
  To make the honey garlic chicken bites:

  Add the chicken breast cubes to a large salad bowl together with cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Mix to evenly coat all the chicken pieces.

  To make the honey garlic chicken bites:

  Heat the oil in a large skillet, over medium-high heat. Melt butter into the oil and add the chicken breast cubes and cook on all sides until golden brown, for about 6-8 minutes. You may need to work in batches, to avoid overcrowding the pan and steaming the chicken bites.

  To make the honey garlic chicken bites:

  Once the chicken is done cooking, pour over the garlic, honey, chicken stock, lemon juice, and hot sauce (if using) and stir to completely coat; allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes to meld all the flavors and reduce a little until it sticks to the chicken bites.

  To make the honey garlic chicken bites:

  Garnish the honey garlic chicken bites with fresh chopped parsley and red chili pepper flakes, then serve over rice. Enjoy!
