ingredients: |
  1 tbsp honey
  1 juice 1 lemon
  250 ml chicken stock
  1 tbsp soy sauce
  4 chicken breasts (cut into chunks)
  1 tbsp cornflour
  1 tsp vegetable oil
  2 carrots (finely sliced)
  1 red pepper (cut into chunks)
  140 g sugar snap pea
directions: |
  In a jug, mix together the honey, lemon, stock and soy, then set aside. Toss the chicken with the cornflour so itâ€™s completely coated. Heat the oil in a non-stick frying pan, then fry the chicken until it changes colour and starts to become crisp around the edges.

  Add the carrots and red pepper, then fry for 1 min more. Pour the stock into the pan, bring to a simmer, then add the sugar snap peas and bubble everything together for 5 mins until the chicken is cooked and the veg are tender. Serve with noodles.
