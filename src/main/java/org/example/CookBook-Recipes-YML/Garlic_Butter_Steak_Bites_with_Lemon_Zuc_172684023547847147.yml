  Zucchini Noodles tends to render a lot of water when cooking (so you can sprinkle with salt after spiralizing and allow to sit for a couple of minutes to take off excess water. Rinse well to get rid of salt and drain thoroughly in a colander before cooking.)
  1 Instead of broth (you can enrich the dish with dry white wine.)
