  3 garlic cloves (crushed)
  1 good chunk fresh root ginger (grated)
  1 red chilli (deseeded and chopped)
  1 tbsp soy sauce
  2 tbsp tomato purée
  2 chicken breasts (cut into chunky strips)
  3 blocks dried egg noodles
  0.5 a head broccoli (broken into florets)
  3 carrots (cut into thin sticks)
  1 tbsp vegetable oil
  300 g pack beansprout
  3 spring onions (halved and sliced into long strips)
  1 tbsp oyster sauce
directions: |
  Mix together the garlic, ginger, chilli, soy sauce and tomato purée, then add the chicken and leave it to marinate while you prep the rest of the ingredients.

  Boil a large pan of water, add the noodles, broccoli and carrots, then cook for 4 mins before draining.

  Heat the vegetable oil in a wok, tip in the chicken and its marinade, then stir-fry for 4-5 mins until cooked. Toss in the noodles, vegetables, beansprouts and spring onion to warm through, then mix the oyster sauce with 2 tbsp water and stir this in just before serving.
