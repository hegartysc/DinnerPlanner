ingredients: |
  20 g unsalted butter
  1 Olive oil (for drizzling)
  6 pork sausages
  350 g chestnut mushrooms (sliced)
  1 tsp sweet smoked paprika
  300 ml sour cream
  0.5 tbsp wholegrain mustard
  150 ml beef stock
  400 g dried tagliatelle
  1 small bunch parsley (chopped)

  Heat the butter and oil in a frying pan over a medium-high heat until foaming. Squeeze large chunks of the sausagemeat out of the skins and into the pan. Cook for 5-8 mins or until golden brown. Add the mushrooms and cook for a further 5 mins until starting to turn brown. Stir through the paprika and cook for 1 min before stirring in the soured cream, mustard and stock. Bring to a simmer and season to taste.

  Meanwhile, cook the pasta in a large pan of salted water according to pack instructions, then add to the sauce with half the parsley. Serve in deep bowls with the remaining parsley sprinkled on top.
