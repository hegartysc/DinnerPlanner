ingredients: |
  1 tbsp soy sauce
  1 tbsp dry sherry
  2 tsp sesame oil
  1 fat garlic clove (crushed)
  1 tsp finely chopped fresh root ginger (or fresh ginger paste in a jar)
  200 g lean sirloin steak (thinly sliced across the grain)
  1 tbsp sesame seeds
  1 tbsp sunflower oil
  1 large carrot (cut into matchsticks)
  100 g mangetout (halved lengthways)
  140 g mushrooms (sliced)
  3 tbsp hoisin sauce
  Chinese noodles (to serve)
directions: |
  Mix together the soy sauce, sherry, sesame oil, garlic and ginger in a shallow dish. Add the steak and leave to marinate for about 20 minutes (or longer, if you have time).

  Heat a large heavy-based frying pan or wok, add the sesame seeds and toast over a high heat, stirring, for a few minutes until golden. Tip on to a plate.

  When ready to cook, heat the sunflower oil in a large frying pan or wok until hot. Add the steak with the marinade and stir fry for 3-4 minutes over a high heat until lightly browned. Remove, using a slotted spoon, on to a plate, leaving the juices in the pan.

  Toss the carrots in the pan and stir fry for a few minutes, then add the mangetout and cook for a further 2 minutes.

  Return the steak to the pan, add the mushrooms and toss everything together. Add the hoisin sauce and stir fry for a final minute. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds and serve immediately.
