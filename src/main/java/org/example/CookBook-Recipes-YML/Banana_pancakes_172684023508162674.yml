ingredients: |
  1 small knob of butter (for frying)
  1 banana
  1 egg
  1 heaped tbsp self-raising flour
  0.5 tsp baking powder
  1 chopped strawberries and banana (to serve, optional)
  1 maple syrup (to serve, optional)
directions: |
  Melt the butter in a non-stick frying pan over a low-medium heat. Meanwhile, add the banana, egg, flour and baking powder to a blender and blitz for 20 seconds.

  Pour three little puddles straight from the blender into the frying pan. Cook for 1 min or until the tops start to bubble, then flip with a fork or a fish slice and cook for 20-30 seconds more. Repeat with the rest of the mixture to make three more pancakes.

  Serve the pancakes with chopped strawberries or banana and a splash of maple syrup, if you like.
