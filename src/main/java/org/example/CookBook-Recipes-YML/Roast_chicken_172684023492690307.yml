ingredients: |
  1 whole chicken
  40 g knob of butter
  2 tsp sea salt
directions: |
  Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Sit your chicken in a roasting tin. Ease the skin away from the breast and push the butter underneath the skin.

  Sprinkle the skin with the sea salt and some black pepper. Pour water into the bottom of the roasting tin to fill it about 1-2cm deep.

  Cover the chicken with foil and roast for 1 hr. Remove the foil and continue to roast for 20-30 mins until the skin is golden, the chicken is cooked and all the juices run clear.

  Pour the juices into a jug to use in gravy. Put the chicken on a board and cover with foil and a clean towel or tea towel. Leave it to rest for 15-20 mins, then carve.
