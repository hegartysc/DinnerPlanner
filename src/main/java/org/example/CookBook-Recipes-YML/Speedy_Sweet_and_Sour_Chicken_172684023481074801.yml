ingredients: |
  260 g diced chicken breast
  150 g jasmine rice
  1 bell pepper
  1 onion
  20 g cashew nuts
  1 Tomato paste
  1 Red wine vinegar
  1 Ketjap Manis
directions: |
  Cook the rice. Drain and leave to the side until ready to serve.

  Meanwhile, halve the pepper and discard the core and seeds. Slice into thin strips.

  Halve and peel the onion, then cut each half into 3 wedges.

  Place a pan over medium-high heat with a drizzle of oil.

  Once the oil is hot, add the chicken to the pan and season.

  Fry until starting to brown, 5-7 mins.

  Add the onion and pepper to the pan and fry until softened, stirring occasionally 4-5 mins.

  Stir in the ketjap manis, vinegar, tomato paste, and 100ml water.

  Leave to simmer until sauce is thickened and the chicken is cooked through 3-5 mins.

  Once cooked, add 2 tbsp sugar to the sauce and season.

  Divide the rice between deep bowls. Top with the sweet and sour chicken. Garnish with cashews.
