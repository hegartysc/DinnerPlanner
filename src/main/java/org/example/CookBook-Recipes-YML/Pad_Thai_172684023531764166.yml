  Toss chicken with rice noodles and stir-fried veg to create a deliciously healthy dinner. There's a vegan option, too, which uses peanut butter (see tip, below)
ingredients: |
  100 g brown rice flat noodles
  1 tbsp rapeseed oil
  2 skinless chicken thigh fillets (chopped)
  1 onion (roughly chopped, 160g)
  1 red pepper (deseeded and cut into thin slices)
  1 small carrot (peeled into thick ribbons using a veg peeler, 60g)
  3 garlic cloves (sliced)
  1 red chilli (deseeded and thinly sliced)
  1 tbsp finely grated ginger
  100 g beansprouts
  15 g roasted unsalted peanuts
  2 tbsp lime juice (plus 1 tsp zest)
  1 tbsp low-salt soy sauce
  15 g chopped coriander
  handful of chopped basil
directions: |
  Tip the noodles into a bowl and soak following pack instructions until tender but not soft – you don’t want them to become mushy. Drain.

  Heat the oil in a wok over a medium-high heat and stir-fry the chicken for 5 mins until cooked. Transfer the chicken to a bowl and set aside, keeping the oil in the wok. Stir-fry the onion, pepper and carrot for 5 mins to soften, then add the garlic, chilli and ginger, and cook for a few minutes more until fragrant.

  Add the beansprouts, turn up the heat to high, and stir through the peanuts, lime juice and zest and the soy sauce. Return the chicken to the pan along with the noodles and herbs, and gently toss everything together until heated through. Best served straightaway.
