notes: |
  A crazy idea that ends up to be the best of both worlds: ramen and omelette smashed together in one skillet! Easy to make and a great quick breakfast (especially if you were over-served the night before)!
ingredients: |
  1 package ramen noodles
  2 large eggs
  1 teaspoon oil
  Chili garlic sauce (garnish)
  Scallions (garnish)
directions: |
  Cook ramen according to package but donâ€™t add spice pack to water. When ramen is cooked, drain it, rinse with cold water, and then dry it on a few paper towels.

  Whisk together eggs with 2 teaspoons of spice seasoning from ramen package.

  Heat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add oil and half of the ramen noodles (you can save the rest for your next ramelette!) Let the noodles cook for one minute.

  Add whisked eggs and stir the eggs gently to make sure they are evenly distributed. Cook for about 2 minutes until eggs are set.

  Flip the omelette! Be confident with it and use a spatula to help lift it. Cook for another 30-60 seconds on the second side.

  Slide ramelette out onto a plate and cut into quarters. Garnish with chili garlic sauce and scallions.
