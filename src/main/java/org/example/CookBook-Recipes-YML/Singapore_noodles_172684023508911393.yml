ingredients: |
  3 nests medium egg noodles
  2 tbsp sunflower oil
  100 g tenderstem broccoli (stems sliced at an angle)
  1 red pepper (deseeded, quartered then cut into strips)
  85 g baby corn (quartered lenthways)
  2 garlic cloves (shredded)
  1 red chilli (deseeded and chopped)
  1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger (peeled and finely chopped)
  2 skinless chicken breasts (sliced)
  100 g shelled raw king prawns
  1 heaped tbsp Madras curry paste
  2 tsp soy sauce
  100 g beansprouts
  15 g pack coriander (chopped)
  4 spring onions (shredded)
  1 lime wedges (for squeezing)
directions: |
  Pour boiling water over the noodles and leave to soften. Meanwhile, heat half the oil in a large non-stick wok and stir-fry all the vegetables, except the beansprouts and onions, with the garlic, chilli and ginger until softened. If the broccoli wonâ€™t soften, add a splash of water to the wok and cover to create some steam.

  Tip the veg on to a plate, add the rest of the oil to the wok then briefly stir-fry the chicken and prawns until just cooked. Set aside with the vegetables and add the curry paste to the pan. Stir-fry for a few secs then add 150ml water and the soy sauce. Allow to bubble then add the drained, softened noodles and beansprouts, and toss together to coat.

  Return the vegetables, chicken and prawns to the wok with the coriander and spring onions. Toss well over the heat and serve with lime wedges.
