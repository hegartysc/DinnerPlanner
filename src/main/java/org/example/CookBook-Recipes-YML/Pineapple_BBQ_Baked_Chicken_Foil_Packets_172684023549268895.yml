ingredients: |
  4 skinless (boneless chicken breasts)
  2 cups pineapple chunks (we recommend fresh apple, but frozen is fine too)
  1 red bell pepper (diced)
  1 green bell pepper (diced)
  Coarse salt and fresh cracked black pepper (to taste)
  0.5 cup of your favorite prepared bbq sauce
  3 clove garlic (minced, or 2 teaspoons dried garlic)
  1.5 teaspoon smoked paprika
  2 tablespoons olive oil
  1 jalapeño (sliced)
  2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
  1 teaspoon dried oregano
  Chopped cilantro (to taste)
  1 Cooking time can vary based on the size and thickness of your chicken breasts. Ensure the chicken reaches 165°F to be properly cooked. (74ºC)
  1 If your chicken breasts are too thick (just cut lengthwise to make fillets, they will cook faster.)
  1 If aluminum foil is a concern for you (you can use parchment paper to make the packets. Use a stapler or paperclips to maintain the fold. You can also double the foil with parchment paper on the inside.)
  Other vegetables to accompany the baked chicken in foil: Make it low carb with cauliflower (zucchini, or broccoli. OR! Carb it up with potatoes cut into cubes!)
  1 Crock Pot Lemon Garlic Butter Chicken
  1 Creamy Chicken Soup with Pasta and Spinach
  1 CrockPot Tuscan Garlic Chicken With Spinach and Sun-Dried Tomatoes
  1 Chicken with Spinach in Creamy Parmesan Sauce

  To make the baked chicken foil packets:

  Pre-heat your oven to 350°F (180°C). Lay four 12×12 inch (30×30 cm) squares of foil out on your work surface. Place pineapple chunks, and bell peppers in the middle of each piece of foil. Season with salt and pepper, then top with each chicken breast. Season chicken with salt and pepper generously.

  To make the baked chicken foil packets:

  In a bowl, combine bbq sauce, olive oil, paprika, minced garlic, lemon juice, oregano, cilantro, and jalapeño. Divide the sauce over each chicken pack and sprinkle with additional chopped cilantro.

  To make the baked chicken foil packets:

  Fold the foil over the chicken and vegetables to close off the pack, pinch the ends together so the pack stays closed.

  To make the baked chicken foil packets:

  Transfer the chicken foil packs to a baking sheet and bake for 35-40 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and veggies are tender. When chicken is done, carefully open the foil packs, drizzle with more sauce and broil for 1 or 2 minutes to crisp up the chicken.

  To make the baked chicken foil packets:

  Serve the baked chicken foil packets immediately, garnished with more cilantro. Enjoy!

  Note:

  If your chicken breasts are too thick, just cut lengthwise to make fillets, they will cook faster.
