notes: |
  Try this no-fuss, midweek meal that's high in protein and big on flavour. Marinate chicken breasts, then drizzle with a punchy peanut satay sauce
ingredients: |
  1 tbsp tamari
  1 tsp medium curry powder
  0.25 tsp ground cumin
  1 garlic clove (finely grated)
  1 tsp clear honey
  2 skinless chicken breast fillets (or use turkey breast)
  1 tbsp crunchy peanut butter (choose a sugar-free version with no palm oil, if possible)
  1 tbsp sweet chilli sauce
  1 tbsp lime juice
  1 sunflower oil (for wiping the pan)
  2 Little Gem lettuce hearts (cut into wedges)
  0.25 cucumber (halved and sliced)
  1 banana shallot (halved and thinly sliced)
  1 coriander (chopped)
  1 seeds from 1/2 pomegranate
directions: |
  Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin, garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat. Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate the chicken.

  Meanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but still moist. Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.

  While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.
