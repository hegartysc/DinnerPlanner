notes: |
  Enjoy a version of Chinese scrambled eggs. It takes just 10 minutes to make, and you can add your choice of protein – prawns, chicken, tofu or char siu pork
ingredients: |
  2 tbsp groundnut oil
  150 g protein of choice (such as raw king prawns or cooked chicken, cooked char siu pork or pre-fried tofu, cut into bite-sized pieces, de-shelled and de-veined)
  1 small white onion (cut into strips)
  40 g sliced mushrooms
  40 g peas
  0.25 tsp white pepper
  4 eggs (whisked)
directions: |
  Heat a wok over a medium-high heat. Once hot, pour in the oil, then add your protein of choice and spread it out across the bottom of the wok. When it begins to brown, add the sliced onion and continue to cook for 1-2 mins, stirring regularly, to soften slightly. Tip in the mushrooms and stir.

  When the mushrooms have started to soften, add the peas along with the white pepper and ½ tsp salt. Stir-fry for 1 min, then add the whisked eggs. Try not to stir the eggs – instead, pick up the wok and swirl the eggs around the rest of the ingredients. Once they begin to set, slowly fold into the rest of the dish. Remove from the heat as soon as the eggs have nearly cooked all the way through.
