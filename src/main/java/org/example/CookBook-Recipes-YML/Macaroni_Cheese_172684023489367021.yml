ingredients: |
  700 ml milk
  1 onion (peeled and halved)
  1 garlic clove (peeled)

  50 g plain flour

  50 g coarse white breadcrumb
directions: |
  Prepare the pasta:

  In a small pan, warm the milk, onion and garlic until almost boiling. Remove from the heat, leave covered to infuse for 10 mins, then strain.

  Prepare the pasta:

  Cook the macaroni according to pack instructions until just soft, but still with a little bite. This will take about 10 mins. Drain in a colander, then run under the tap and stir to stop the pasta sticking together.

  Make a roux:

  Heat oven to fan 170C and butter a 25 x 18cm ovenproof dish.

  Make a roux:

  Melt the butter in the medium pan. When foaming, add the flour, then cook, stirring constantly, for 1 min on a low heat.

  Finish the sauce:

  Slowly stir the warm infused milk into the roux until smooth. Simmer for 3-4 mins, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened and has a coating consistency (run your finger through the sauce on a spoon â€“ it should leave a trail). Remove the pan from the heat, then add the cheddar. Season, then stir until the cheese has melted.

  Assemble and bake:

  Mix the cheesesauce through the macaroni to coat it well, then tip into the prepared dish. Sprinkle more cheese and breadcrumbs over the top, then bake for 15-20 mins until golden brown and bubbling. Serve piping hot on its own or with a green salad.
