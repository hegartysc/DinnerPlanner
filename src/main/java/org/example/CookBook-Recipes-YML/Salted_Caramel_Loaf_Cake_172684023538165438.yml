  Light and fluffy brown sugar sponge, salted caramel buttercream, caramel drizzle and fudge chunks.
  
  If you can’t find salted caramel, use ordinary caramel such as carnation caramel and add 1/4 tsp salt to the 50g of caramel and mix well.
  For the decoration, you can use plain fudge chopped up, salted caramel fudge or the fudge chunks that you can buy in the baking aisle
  I used a Wilton 2D piping tip for the buttercream.
  Cooking times vary, this cake can take anywhere from 50 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes to bake, possibly longer. Keep checking every few minutes and don’t overbake.
  This cake will last 3-4 days if stored in an airtight container.
ingredients: |
  For the cake:
  4 Free-range eggs Medium
  230 g Butter/Baking spread
  230 g Light brown sugar
  230 g Self-raising flour
  For the buttercream:
  150 g Butter
  300 g Icing sugar
  50 g Salted Caramel I use Jude's or Bonne Maman
  For the decoration:
  50 g Salted Caramel
  1 Fudge chunks or chopped fudge
directions: |
  Preheat the oven to 180C/160 Fan. Grease and line a 2lb loaf tin, set aside.

  Using a mixer, cream together the brown sugar and Stork/Butter until light and fluffy- around 3 minutes.

  Gradually add the eggs and flour until well combined- around 20 seconds. Be careful not to overmix.

  Put the cake batter into the prepared tin and bake for around 50 minutes - 1 hour 10 minutes until a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean.

  Remove the cake from the oven and leave to cool for 10 minutes. Turn it out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely, around 1 hour.

  To make the buttercream, mix together the soft butter and icing sugar until smooth, around 3-5 minutes. Add the 50g of caramel and mix until just combined.

  Pipe the buttercream onto the cake using a Wilton 2D piping tip. Alternatively, spread the buttercream onto the cake using a palette knife or spoon.

  To decorate, drizzle extra caramel over the top of the cake using a piping bag or spoon. Sprinkle with fudge chunks or chopped fudge.
