ingredients: |
  2 tablespoons vegetable oil (divided)
  8 ounces skinless (boneless chicken breast, cut into strips)
  0.5 red bell pepper (chopped)
  0.5 cup green onion (chopped)
  4 cloves garlic (minced)
  3 cups cooked brown rice
  2 tablespoons light soy sauce
  1 tablespoon rice vinegar
  1 cup frozen peas (thawed)
directions: |
  Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large skillet set over medium heat. Add the chicken, bell pepper, green onion and garlic. Cook and stir until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Remove the chicken to a plate and keep warm.

  Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the rice; cook and stir to heat through. Stir in the soy sauce, rice vinegar and peas, and continue to cook for 1 minute. Return the chicken mixture to the skillet and stir to blend with the rice and heat through before serving.
