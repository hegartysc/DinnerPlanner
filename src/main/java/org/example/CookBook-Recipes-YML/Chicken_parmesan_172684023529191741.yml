  Looking for a healthier chicken parmigiana recipe? We've given the classic a makeover, resulting in a hearty yet healthy dish that's great for weeknight dinners
ingredients: |
  2 large (skinless chicken breasts, halved through the middle)
  2 eggs (beaten)
  75 g breadcrumb
  75 g parmesan (grated)
  1 tbsp olive oil
  2 garlic cloves (crushed)
  0.5 a 690 ml jar passata
  1 tsp caster sugar
  1 tsp dried oregano
  0.5 a 125 g ball light mozzarella (torn)
directions: |
  Halve 2 large skinless chicken breasts through the middle then place the 4 pieces between cling film sheets and bash out with a rolling pin until they are the thickness of a Â£1 coin.

  Dip in 2 beaten eggs, then 75g breadcrumbs, mixed with half of the 75g grated parmesan. Set aside on a plate in the fridge while you make the sauce.

  Heat 1 tbsp olive oil and cook 2 crushed garlic cloves for 1 min, then tip in half a 690ml jar passata, 1 tsp caster sugar and 1 tsp dried oregano. Season and simmer for 5-10 mins.

  Heat grill to High and cook the chicken for 5 mins each side, then remove.

  Pour the tomato sauce into a shallow ovenproof dish and top with the chicken.

  Scatter over torn pieces of half a 125g ball light mozzarella, and the remaining grated parmesan and grill for 3-4 mins until the cheese has melted and the sauce is bubbling.

  Serve with vegetables or salad and some pasta or potatoes, if you like.
