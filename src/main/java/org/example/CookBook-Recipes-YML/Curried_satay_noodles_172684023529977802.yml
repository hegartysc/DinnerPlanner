  Serve up some quick and easy curried noodles. Packed with wholewheat, pulses, vegetables and spices, this recipe is full of healthy plant-based foods
ingredients: |
  150 g dried wholewheat noodles
  2 tsp rapeseed oil
  1 red pepper (halved seeded and thinly sliced)
  1 carrot (cut into matchsticks, about 90g)
  1 tbsp finely chopped ginger
  3 garlic cloves (finely chopped)
  1 chilli (deseeded and finely chopped, optional)
  0.5 tsp cumin seeds
  2 tsp curry powder (1-2)
  2.5 -3 tbsp crunchy peanut butter
  1 tbsp tomato purée
  150 ml vegetable stock (made with 1⁄2 tsp vegetable bouillon)
  100 g frozen peas
  0.5 lemon (juiced)
directions: |
  Boil the noodles following pack instructions, then rinse well to ensure the strands are separate. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a wok or sauté pan over a high heat and stir-fry the pepper, carrot, ginger, garlic and chilli, if using, for 5 mins until softened. Stir in the cumin seeds and curry powder and cook for 30 seconds or so until aromatic.

  Mix the peanut butter and tomato purée with the vegetable stock until smooth. Add the drained noodles to the wok along with the frozen peas, then pour in the peanut and tomato mixture and toss everything together. If it seems a bit claggy, stir in a drop more water. Squeeze in the lemon juice, toss well and serve. This recipe is part of our free 7-day healthy diet plan.
