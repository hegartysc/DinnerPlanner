ingredients: |
  2 tbsp honey
  1 tbsp soy sauce
  1 tsp rice vinegar
  3 garlic cloves (finely chopped then crushed)
  1 tbsp vegetable oil
  1 tbsp unsalted butter (melted)
  2 pork chops
  1 small handful of fresh parsley (to serve, optional)
directions: |
  Combine the honey, soy, rice vinegar and garlic in a small bowl. Mix the oil and butter in another bowl.

  Heat a griddle pan over a high heat until searing hot. Brush the pork chops all over with the oil and butter mixture, season, then cook for 4-6 mins, turning halfway, until cooked through.

  Lift the pork out of the pan and onto a plate using tongs, then brush the honey mixture over both sides and return to the pan to cook for a further minute on each side.

  Rest the chops for a couple of minutes, then drizzle over any juices from the pan to serve. Sprinkle with the parsley to finish, if you like.
