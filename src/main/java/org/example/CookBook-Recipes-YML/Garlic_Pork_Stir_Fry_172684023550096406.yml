  Meat
ingredients: |
  1 lb pork ribs or shoulder (cut into 1-inch cubes, 450g, country style, deboned)
  2 teaspoons cornstarch (optional)
  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
  1 tablespoon olive oil
  1 tablespoon unsalted butter
  4 cloves garlic (finely minced)
  0.25 cup honey
  3 tablespoons low-sodium chicken or beef stock
  1 or 2 tablespoons of lemon juice
  1 teaspoon hot sauce (optional, we used Sriracha)
  1 teaspoon red chili pepper flakes for garnish
  1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley and scallion for garnish
directions: |
  To make the honey garlic pork stir-fry: Add the diced pork to a large salad bowl with cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Mix to coat all the pork pieces evenly.

  Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Melt butter into the oil, add the seasoned pork cubes, and cook on all sides until golden brown, for about 6-8 minutes. You may need to work in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan and steaming the pork bites instead of browning them.

  Once the pork is done cooking, pour over the garlic, honey, chicken stock (or beef stock), lemon juice, and hot sauce (if using) and stir to coat completely; allow the sauce to simmer for a couple of minutes to meld all the flavors and reduce a little until it sticks to the pork bites.

  Garnish the honey garlic pork bites with fresh chopped parsley and red chili pepper flakes, then serve over your side of choice. Enjoy! ❤️
