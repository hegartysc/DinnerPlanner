notes: |
  Try this one-pan piri piri chicken for a family dinner and adjust the chilli levels to suit your family's tolerance. You can use a whole chicken instead, if you like
ingredients: |
  1 kg bone-in chicken thighs and drumsticks (equal quantities of each saves any arguments)
  500 g baby potatoes (thickly sliced)
  2 peppers (thickly sliced, 1 red, 1 yellow)
  200 g cherry tomatoes
  handful of coriander leaves (chopped)
  buttered corn on the cob (to serve)
  1.5 tsp smoked paprika
  25 g light brown soft sugar
  1 lime (zested and juiced)
  1 tsp dried chilli flakes (use less if you prefer less heat)
  2 garlic cloves (chopped)
  4 tbsp olive oil
  0.5 bunch of fresh oregano (leaves picked or 1 tbsp dried oregano)
  1 red chilli (deseeded and chopped, optional)
  1 tbsp red wine or port (optional)
directions: |
  Pound all the marinade ingredients together with 1 tsp salt using a large pestle and mortar, or blitz in a mini chopper to create a loose paste. Slash each chicken piece a few times, then tip into a bowl and coat in the marinade. Cover and chill for at least 1 hr or up to 24 hrs.

  Heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the chicken along with the marinade and potatoes into a roasting tin. Toss together, then arrange the chicken on top of the potatoes, thighs skin-side up. Roast for 35-40 mins until the chicken has browned.

  Remove the tin from the oven and mix the peppers in with the potatoes, baste the chicken in some of the juices in the tin and turn the drumsticks. Nestle the cherry tomatoes in among the chicken and roast for another 20-25 mins until the chicken is cooked through, the skin is crisp and the vegetables are nicely roasted. Scatter with the coriander and some flaky sea salt, if you like, and serve straight from the tin with the buttered corn on the side.
